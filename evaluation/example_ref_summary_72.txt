Supply Chain Sustainability is a new and highly influential debate that has drawn the attention of researchers in the field of supply chain management. This concept is particularly important in the oil and gas industry because of its nature and the risks and sustainability risks associated with this industry, especially environmental hazards. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risks related to supply chain sustainability in the oil and gas industry based on the FMEA method. The statistical population of this study consisted of all experts familiar with the concept of sustainability in the oil and gas industry, out of which 10 experts were selected and surveyed through snowball sampling. The results showed that among the risks posed in the field of supply chain sustainability in the oil and gas industry, risks such as failure and pollution in surface (hydrological) and groundwater (hydrogeological) systems and flows, energy price fluctuations and sanctions as well as the emission of hazardous and greenhouse gases, the reduction of air quality and climate change were prioritized over other risks, as well as sustainability commitment (organizational culture, top management leadership and transparency), management readiness (risk management, cross-functional teams and performance management) and external factors (political stability, economic stability, stakeholder pressure, energy transition policies, and laws and regulations) can all play an important role in managing the risks associated with this industry.
